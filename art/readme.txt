Attached are the assets as listed on the Google Play guidelines provided by Nathan. You will notice that the name has had a slight tweak, this is due to trademark issues and a rethink of the use of the 'i'. the official title is now 'eyeWitness to atrocities' or 'eyeWitness'. Please also note the use of upper and lowercase in the title.

The colours used in the logo and therefore hopefully in the app are:

Blue: #4db1e4
Dark grey: #231f20
Light grey: #818285
